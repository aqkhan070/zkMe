# zkMe Wallet KYC & MeID Integration

This project is a simple React frontend that integrates zkMe's KYC (zkKYC) and Identity (MeID) verification flows.  
It allows users to:

- Connect their MetaMask wallet
- Start MeID verification
- Start KYC verification
- See success or failure messages after completing verification

git clone <your-repo-url>

```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173].

## ⚙️ Configuration

Go to `src/App.jsx` and update these fields with your own zkMe credentials:

```javascript
new ZkMeWidget(
  'your-mchNo',     // Replace with your Merchant No
  'your-app-name',  // Your App Name
  '0x61',           // Your chain ID (HEX)
  provider,
  {
    lv: 'zkKYC' or 'MeID',  // Choose verification level
    programNo: 'your-program-id',
    theme: 'dark',
    locale: 'en',
  }
)
```

### 🔑 Backend API

Make sure you have a working backend endpoint that issues zkMe access tokens at:

```
https://nest-api.zk.me/api/token/get
```

(This is required for proper authentication.)
